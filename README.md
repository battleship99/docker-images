For dockerfile and sample run scripts, please visit: 
https://github.com/fzinfz/docker-images

Some of images were built on docker hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/fzinfz

# Naming rules
`_manage.d` contains scripts for docker management.  

`./_build.sh` to show docker build commands.  
Run and edit `_run.sh` to customize pre-defined docker run commands.  

Folders end with `.conf.d` are for config files;   
other folders are for `Dockerfile` files and maybe `README.md`.
