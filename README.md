# Repo naming rules
`_manage.d` contains scripts for docker management.  
`./_build.sh` to show docker build commands.  
Edit `_run.sh` to customize pre-defined docker run commands.  
Folders end with `.conf.d` are for config files; other folders use image name as folder name and contains `Dockerfile` files and maybe `README.md`, some of images were built on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fzinfz/).
